# Example Java App For Infinitic

Implementing a booking process combining a car rental, a flight, and a hotel reservation. 
We require that all 3 bookings have to be successful together: 
if any of them fails, we should cancel the other bookings that were successful.

This repository is described in the Infinitic documentation: https://docs.infinitic.io/overview/example-app

## Before running
- If needed, update credentials in configs/infinitic.yml
- run `gradle setupPulsar` (only once) to setup your Pulsar namespace

## Running services separately
- run bookingWorkflow service: `gradle run --args=configs/bookingWorkflow.yml`
- run carRental service: `gradle run --args=configs/carRental.yml`
- run flightBooking service: `gradle run --args=configs/flightBooking.yml`
- run hotelBooking service: `gradle run --args=configs/hotelBooking.yml`

## Running services all together
If you do not want to run each service separately, just `gradle run`

## Launch
Launch one or more workflows! `gradle startWorkflow`


Note: workflows will never complete if one of services is not running. But,
- you can run as many instances of each service that you want;
- you can run each service f from a different network as soon as they access the same Pulsar namespace.
